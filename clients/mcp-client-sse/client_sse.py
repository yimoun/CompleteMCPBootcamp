"""
client_sse.py

This file implements an MCP client that connects to an MCP server using SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport.
SSE is a technology that allows a server to push real-time updates to a client over a single, persistent HTTP connection.
Unlike websockets, SSE provides one-way communication from the server to the client, which is useful for streaming updates.

This client also uses Google's Gemini SDK for AI model integration. The Gemini API can perform natural language processing
tasks and, when needed, call external tools (in this case, MCP tools) to perform specific functions.

A stream manager (or stream context) in this code is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the SSE connection,
ensuring that the connection is properly opened and closed. We use asynchronous context managers to handle these resources safely.
